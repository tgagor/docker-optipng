[![build](https://github.com/tgagor/docker-optipng/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/tgagor/docker-optipng/actions/workflows/build.yml)

This is simple image with optipng executable.

I use it for image optimization in some CI/CD pipelines.

You can fetch docker image from:
* [tgagor/optipng](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/tgagor/optipng)

Beware that image sets `ENTRYPOINT` straight to `optipng`.
